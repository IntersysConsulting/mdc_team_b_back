# Team B
**B** *(ring excellence)*

Team B's back end is being developed in Python (Flask), and is part of the INgage program for the fourth generation of INgagers. 
### What is this project about?

The INgage project for our generation is an eShop called eCommerce, where we set up a project from scratch and, thanks to our wonderful mentors, work to deliver a product sprint after sprint.
